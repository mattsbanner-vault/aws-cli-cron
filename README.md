# AWS CLI Cron
**AWS CLI 2**

Simple docker container, for running AWS CLI commands via Cron.

Built for syncing to S3 buckets, so likely missing a lot of features outside of that. As and when my AWS usage is increased, I may well add more to this project. In the meantime, please feel free to submit a PR.

Please report all [issues](https://github.com/mattsbanner/aws-cli-cron/issues) on GitHub rather than DockerHub.
